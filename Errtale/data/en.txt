Long long ago,there were two races--HUMANS and MONSTERS
One day,war broke out between the two races
At last,the human won and sealed the monsters undergound with a magic spell
Incredibly,the monsters built a civilization undergound
They have had a peaceful life for a quite some time
In 201X,however,a small child fell into Mt.Ebbot
And the child led the civilization become friendly with humans
While in 202X,things changed,a human became evil and killed all of the human
And he also killed all of the monsters except........
me!!!!!
And you,are the guy...........
My friend,my family,my world were all destroyed by you,a silly child.....
Good bye.......
Let's go to the theme...
--------BUTCHER OVER------------
*Don't Give up!Keep your determination
*Because you will die harder than this time!
I can't help to praise that you are a nice cheater
But I doesn't matter,you will die later
I don't think that you can try to beat me so many times
Unless you were punished by me or you cheated
You.....seemed familiar to me
I rememered that you have been defeated by me once
You..Oh!I know,the previous and the only chanllenger
Welcome......to be killed again!
Hey!This try seemed to be the third time
Do you think this is funny??
Hurry up!The fourth time!
I think you can make it.....after you died
Corpses not exceed over five.What?You don't know the meaning
Things can't exceed over five!
........................................................
..Just keep trying
I finally saw a memory cheater today!
Congratulations!You've accomplished the most......easiest stage.Look at your health.
Maybe you could finish the next stage
It seems that you are hard to finish the next stage
It's almost.......impossible,haha!
Oh!You fucking cheater...
Without hurt?You are strong,maybe you've tried many times.
Uhm.....It's time to say "meet you again"
